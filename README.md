Created with Next.js, Middleware, Spotify API, Tailwind CSS, NextAuth & Recoil

## Deployed Website
Be aware that Spotify API only allows remote control. \
This means that you have to play a song on a device in order to use the web app. \

Attention!: If you wish to see the final project deployed, please email me with your full name and spotify email. /
Then i will seek to add you as a user of the spotify API. My email can be found on my [portfolio page](https://jonasegehrke.github.io/react-portfolio/) /
